# CS7643Project
Lyft Motion Prediction Challenge

This project implements the motion prediction algorithm described in the paper linked [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02545) and applies it in the [Lyft Motion Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lyft-motion-prediction-autonomous-vehicles) challenge using the Lyft dataset and using l5kit. The model training and analysis is contained in the NewRnnCnn.ipynb and the model itself is defined in mhajam.py. The dataset definition occurs in MultiAgentLoaders.py.
